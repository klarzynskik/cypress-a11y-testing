# Getting Started

This project was created as a follow-up to the following blog post: [Accessibility Testing](https://developers.livechat.com/updates/livechat-automated-a11y-testing). Each step described in the article is covered in a separate branch (like `step-1`, `step-2`), with the final step being `step-5`.

I recommend you to follow this only with the article linked; otherwise, it might be confusing.
